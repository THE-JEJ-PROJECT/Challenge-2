Challenge 02 - CCOM4995

The Land Of Kirby

Steps:
1. A basic default Kirby with arms, feet, eyes and mouth was created using differently scaled, rotated and positioned spheres parented to one big sphere that made up Kirby’s base body. This parent was named ‘Kirby’ and then dragged into the assets folder to become our default prefab.

2. After right clicking our new prefab, we selected create ‘Prefab Variant’,  which then consisted of magician Kirby, sword Kirby, and hammer Kirby. All of them utilizing the same default prefab with different posing and new 3d objects that represent Kirby’s in-game copy abilities.

3. Finally, after adding a terrain object, the mesh resolution was set to 250x250x250 and its heightmap resolution to 256x256 as indicated. Then we selected a height map portion of Puerto Rico, and tried our best to recreate it mainly using built_in_brush_2, 5 & 6 at a size of 30 and opacity of 15.

4. We then positioned all 4 of our Kirby variants in a corner of the new terrain.

Experience gained / Kirby memories:

Eduardo:
Thanks to this challenge I was able to get used to making prefabs and variants. Alongside that, it helped me see the importance in parenting objects or simply naming parts of Kirby’s model. Making Kirby variants based on its copy abilities was very fulfilling yet fun to try and adapt with basic 3d objects. Finally, I learned how to make a terrain in Unity and make it look somewhat realistic to real life utilizing the correct brushes and settings.

I grew up playing Kirby, and have a warm fondness for the games. I think I played Squeak Squad or Super Star Ultra first when I was very young on my DS, but it was until I got Mass Attack when I actually remember beating the games. I then played Kirby Return To Dreamland on Wii, Kirby’s Epic Yarn, Kirby Triple Deluxe on 3DS which is probably my favorite, and one that I still own. I haven’t really played Kirby since, except for Kirby Adventure via Virtual Console, and don’t really have any interest in playing another currently but I appreciate the games I grew up playing.

Joxanniel:
Through this project, I learned the fundamentals of working with prefabs in Unity, more specifically, how to create and manage prefab variants. By making different versions of a Kirby character, that being sword Kirby, I gained hands-on experience in making variations of a single base prefab. This helped me understand the flexibility that prefabs offer in game development. Additionally, I improved my skills in transforming and manipulating 3D objects within Unity, allowing me to create a terrain with unique colonies for each Kirby variant. 

As for my experience with Kirby, I played Kirby’s Epic Yarn, and I mostly remember playing as him for every single match in Super Smash Bros on the 3DS and Wii.

Jeremy:
While doing this project I improved some of the skills that we learned on the previous challenge, such as the rotate and scale tools. Another skill learned in class was implemented during the completion of the challenge, which was the use of prefabs. Learning how to use the prefabs was fundamental, because it made the job easier when doing the different Kirby variants. In addition, another thing that was very important to implement was the empty object, because it can move the figures as a whole, which later ends up being the prefab. Everything we learned in class was used in order to do the second challenge; in my case I feel like I improved in those areas when doing the Kirby with the hammer. 

I never really played a Kirby game, but I do remember playing Super Smash Bros as a kid on the Wii and fighting against Kirby.
